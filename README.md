* combined_data.csv: This is the dataset being used for EDA and pulling dropdown values from, and it contains the collected and formatted food drive data
* random_forest_regressor_model.pkl: This is a trained random forest regression model that predicts how long a given set of routes will take.
* random_forest_regressor_model_bags.pkl: This is a trained random forest regression model that predicts how many bags a given set of routes will yield.
* requirements.txt: Contains a list of required packages to be installed to properly run the main file.
